    <h4>HMS Pinnafore</h4>
    <H5>ACT I
        SCENE—Quarter-deck of H.M.S. Pinafore. Sailors, led by BOATSWAIN,

        <P>
            CHORUS

We sail the ocean blue,
And our saucy ship's a beauty;
We're sober men and true,
And attentive to our duty.
When the balls whistle free
O'er the bright blue sea,
We stand to our guns all day;
When at anchor we ride
On the Portsmouth tide,
We have plenty of time to play. </P>

<P>   RECITATIVE

    Hail, men-o'-war's men-safeguards of your nation
    Here is an end, at last, of all privation;
    You've got your play—spare all you can afford
    To welcome Little Buttercup on board. </P>

<P>SAILORS.  
         Flags and guns and pennants dipping!
        All the ladies love the shipping </P>

<P>REL.         
    Gaily tripping,
    Lightly skipping,
  Flock the maidens to the shipping </P>

<P>SONG—SIR JOSEPH
    I am the monarch of the sea,
    The ruler of the Queen's Navee,
  Whose praise Great Britain loudly chants. </P>

<P>CAPT. 
    (from poop). Now give three cheers, I'll lead the way </P>

<P>ALL.             
     Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! hurray! </P>
