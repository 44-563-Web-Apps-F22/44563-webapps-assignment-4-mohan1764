    <h4>HMS Pinnafore</h4>
    <H5>ACT I
        SCENE—Quarter-deck of H.M.S. Pinafore. Sailors, led by BOATSWAIN,
        discovered cleaning brasswork, splicing rope, etc. </H5>
    <h6>CHORUS</h6>
        <P>
        We sail the ocean blue,
        And our saucy ship's a beauty;
        We're sober men and true,
        And attentive to our duty.
        When the balls whistle free
        O'er the bright blue sea,
        We stand to our guns all day;
        When at anchor we ride
        On the Portsmouth tide,
        We have plenty of time to play.
        </P>
        <P>(All recoil from him.)</P>
        

    <h6>REC</h6>
    <P>   

    Hail, men-o'-war's men-safeguards of your nation
    Here is an end, at last, of all privation;
    You've got your play—spare all you can afford
    To welcome Little Buttercup on board. </P>
    <p>(looking down hatchway)</p>

    <P>

    All the ladies love the shipping </P>


    <h6>REL</h6>
    <P>        
    Gaily tripping,
    Lightly skipping,
  Flock the maidens to the shipping </P>

    <h6>SON</h6> 
    <P>
    I am the monarch of the sea,
    The ruler of the Queen's Navee,
  Whose praise Great Britain loudly chants. </P>

    <h6>CAP</h6>
    <P> 
    Now give three cheers, I'll lead the way. 
    </P>
    <P>(saluting)</P>
