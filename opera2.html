    <h6 class=" name">CHORUS</h6>      
    <p class="CHORUS song">Sad is that woman's lot who, year by year,
        Sees, one by one, her beauties disappear,
        When Time, grown weary of her heart-drawn sighs,
        Impatiently begins to dim her eyes!
        Compelled, at last, in life's uncertain gloamings,</p>
    <p class="REC song">
        To wreathe her wrinkled brow with well-saved
                 "combings,"
            Reduced, with rouge, lip-shade, and pearly grey,
            To "make up" for lost time as best she may!

            Silvered is the raven hair,
                 Spreading is the parting straight,
            Mottled the complexion fair,
                 Halting is the youthful gait,
            Hollow is the laughter free,
                 Spectacled the limpid eye,
            Little will be left of me
                 In the coming bye and bye!
            Little will be left of me
                 In the coming bye and bye!

            Fading is the taper waist,
                 Shapeless grows the shapely limb,
            And although severely laced,
                 Spreading is the figure trim!

            Stouter than I used to be,
                 Still more corpulent grow Iâ€”
            There will be too much of me
                 In the coming by and bye!
            There will be too much of me
                 In the coming by and bye!

    <p class="direction">[Exit, L., carrying her violoncello.][Enter GROSVENOR, R., followed by MAIDENS, two and two, playing
        on archaic instruments as in Act I.  He is reading
        abstractedly, as BUNTHORNE did in Act I, and pays no
        attention to them.]

    <p class="REL speech" >The old, old tale.  How
        rapturously these maidens love me, and how hopelessly!  [He looks
        up.]  Oh, Patience, Patience, with the love of thee in my heart,
        what have I for these poor mad maidens but an unvalued pity?
        Alas, they will die of hopeless love for me, as I shall die of
        hopeless love for thee!
